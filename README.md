# Introduction

The project starts with taking the different text files and collating them into a single file. This file is inturn used in the analysis. The source of the data is the below:

## Files

The code takes for granted all the data is present in the same folder, un-compressed and without names altered.

CodeBook.md describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data.

run_analysis.R contains all the code to perform the analyses described in the 5 steps. They can be launched in RStudio by just importing the file.

The output of the 5th step is called tidy_averages_data.txt, and uploaded in the course project's form.
